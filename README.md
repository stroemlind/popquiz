## UX
The quiz's theme is to simulate the pop trends of the late '90s and the early '00s, with a mix of bright colors and white.  When visiting the website, the user should get the happy, excited, and hopeful feelings pop music usually gives the listener.

### Colour Scheme
The primary colors used for the website are:
* Purple hex: #DCABFF
* Blue hex: #8299FA 
* Turquoise hex: #5FFDF5
* Orange hex: #DA4500

To get the proper background color gradient, I used the ColorSpace 3-color-gradient generator. The color to get this background are the purple and blue listed above. 

The orange color used is to style the buttons on the website is to create a contrast and make it easier for the user to identify buttons. 

### Typography (explain any fonts and icon libraries used, font-awesome/google fonts, etc)
The font and icon styles have a digital-futuristic and smooth characteristic feel to them.
* The font style for the website is from Google Fonts. 
    * Heading elements have the font style: [Audiowide](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide?query=Audio).
    * The remaining text elements have the font style: [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron?query=orbitr).

* The icons in the footer and the header are from Font Awsome
    * [Disc](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/compact-disc?style=solid) icon in the header
    * [Spotify](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/spotify?style=brands) icon in the footer
