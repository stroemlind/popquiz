## UX
The quiz's theme is to simulate the pop trends of the late '90s and the early '00s, with a mix of bright colors and white.  When visiting the website, the user should get the happy, excited, and hopeful feelings pop music usually gives the listener.

### Colour Scheme
The primary colors used for the website are:
* Purple hex: #DCABFF
* Blue hex: #8299FA 
* Turquoise hex: #5FFDF5
* Orange hex: #DA4500

To get the proper background color gradient, I used the ColorSpace 3-color-gradient generator. The color to get this background are the purple and blue listed above. 

The orange color used is to style the buttons on the website is to create a contrast and make it easier for the user to identify buttons. 

### Typography (explain any fonts and icon libraries used, font-awesome/google fonts, etc)
The font and icon styles have a digital-futuristic and smooth characteristic feel to them.
* The font style for the website is from Google Fonts. 
    * Heading elements have the font style: Audiowide.
    * The remaining text elements have the font style: Orbitron.

* The icons in the footer and the header are from Font Awsome
    * Disc icon in the header
    * Spotify icon in the footer
    * Instagram icon in the footer
